-- Rollback: This migration only cleans data, no schema changes to rollback
-- Note: We cannot restore the original invalid codes as they were removed
-- This is a data cleanup migration with no reversible schema changes

-- The down migration is intentionally empty as we cannot restore deleted invalid codes
-- If rollback is needed, restore from backup or manually re-add codes
